# Week 4 - Azure 
🌩️ Microsoft Azure
Azure is Microsoft’s cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services for building, deploying, and managing applications and data through Microsoft-managed data centers.
In this project, Azure can be used for:
Data Storage & Management — hosting databases such as Azure SQL Database, Blob Storage, or Data Lake.
Data Processing — running ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes with Azure Data Factory or Azure Synapse.
Compute Services — hosting APIs, web apps, or machine learning models.
Security & Access Control — managing credentials, permissions, and secure connections using Azure Active Directory (AAD) and Key Vault.
